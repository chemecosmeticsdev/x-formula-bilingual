# X Formula Platform - Project Overview

## üéØ Project Mission
Create a modern, reliable AI-powered cosmetics formula platform that incorporates all lessons learned from the previous implementation.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Frontend Layer
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- **Components**: shadcn/ui for consistent design system
- **Pages**: Homepage + Generate page (initial scope)

### Backend Integration
- **AI Service**: AWS Bedrock via proven Lambda proxy
- **Lambda Endpoint**: `https://gcle21npca.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat`
- **Fallback System**: Local fallback concepts if Lambda fails
- **No Direct AWS SDK**: Avoids credential and compatibility issues

### Deployment Architecture
- **Primary**: AWS Amplify for seamless CI/CD
- **Environment**: Production-ready with proper env var handling
- **Testing**: Comprehensive local testing before deployment
- **Security**: No hardcoded credentials, proper secret management

## üé® Design System

### Brand Identity
- **Primary Color**: Teal/Turquoise (consistent with original)
- **Typography**: Modern, clean, professional
- **Layout**: Minimalist, focus on functionality
- **Components**: Reusable shadcn/ui elements

### Page Structure
1. **Homepage**
   - Hero section with clear value proposition
   - Features showcase
   - How it works (3-step process)
   - Call-to-action for formula generation

2. **Generate Page**
   - Input form for product specifications
   - Example prompts for guidance
   - Results display (future implementation)
   - Error handling and user feedback

## üîÑ Development Methodology

### Incremental Development
1. **Foundation First**: Setup, documentation, basic structure
2. **UI Implementation**: Homepage and generate page layouts
3. **Service Integration**: Lambda proxy connection
4. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive testing before deployment
5. **Deployment**: AWS Amplify with monitoring

### Quality Assurance
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time error checking
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
- **Local Testing**: Thorough testing before deployment
- **Documentation**: Clear setup and maintenance guides
